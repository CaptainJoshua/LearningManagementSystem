                Mary JV'S School started as JV'S Tutorial and Educational Center in 2004, catering to the call of parents who saw that their children need some tutoring and tapped the help of their neighbour. Mrs. Josephine D. Vito, who readily extended her assistance.
                During that time, there were only six little kids being tutored by Teacher Jo. These young ones made the difference in catapulting the name of JV'S in the community. And soon after, its reputation become a word of mouth to being parent.
